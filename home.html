            Pokémon also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
            The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. 
            Works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All". <br> <br>
            All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by the Pokémon Company International are divided roughly by generation. 
            These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel to the 1996 role-playing video games Pokémon Red and Green is released
            that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. And now we will show you 3 of 8 generation that exist in Pokémon. <br>

            The first one is Generation I (Kanto), The Kanto region is a region of the Pokémon world located east of Johto. It was the first region to be introduced, all cities in Kanto are named after colors (Viridian City, Lavender Town, Indigo Plateau, etc.), 
            with the exception of Pallet Town, which is also a reference to color. Kanto region is the setting of the Generation I games, in Kanto region we will use the Kanto Pokédex to know about the infomartion of the Pokémon because the Kanto Pokédex contains information on the first 151 Pokémon. <br> <br>
            The second is Generation II (Johto), The Johto region is a region of the Pokémon world located west of Kanto, Johto and Kanto are part of a large landmass, with everything west of Indigo Plateau falling in the Johto region.
            It was the second core series region to be introduced. Johto region is the setting of the Generation II games, in Johto region we will use the Johto Pokédex to know about the infomartion of the Pokémon because the Johto Pokédex contains information of 251 Pokémon in Generation II. <br> <br>

            The third is Generation III (Hoenn), The Hoenn region is a region of the Pokémon world located south of Sinnoh. Hoenn is inspired by the real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu.
            The names of most of the cities in Hoenn are made of two words put together (Little Root, Fort Tree, Slate Port, Ever Grande, etc.) rather than colors or plants as Kanto and Johto had done.
            . Hoenn region is the setting of the Generation I games, in Hoenn region we will use the Hoenn Pokédex to know about the infomartion of the Pokémon because the Hoenn Pokédex contains information of 202 Pokémon in Generation III. <br>
