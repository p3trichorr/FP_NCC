                    Description <br> Mudkip is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 3. It is known as the Mud Fish Pokémon. Mudkip is a small, 
                    quadrupedal amphibious Pokémon that resembles mudskipper fishes and axolotls. 
                    It is cyan blue in color, with a light blue neck, underbelly and a tail. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, 
                    deep inside isolated islands, due to their dislike of freshwater lakes and ponds. <br>
